## Introduction
This project utilizes the Amazon US Customer Reviews Dataset to perform topic modeling, aiming to uncover common themes in customer feedback. The analysis employs LDA for topic extraction and visualization techniques like word clouds and bar charts to represent the results.

## Data Sources
The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and contains US customer reviews for Amazon products.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant data and ensuring consistency in textual data.
2. **Topic Modeling:** Apply LDA to extract common topics from the reviews.
3. **Visualization:** Use word clouds and bar charts to represent the most common topics and their frequency.
4. **Reporting:** Outline the methods used, topics discovered, and their influence on product adjustments or marketing strategies.
5. **Presentation:** Create a presentation explaining the findings and recommending actions based on prevalent topics in customer feedback.

## Results
The results section will contain visual representations of the discovered topics and their frequencies, along with an analysis of these findings.

## Conclusions
Based on the prevalent topics discovered from the customer reviews, we provide actionable insights and recommendations for product improvements and marketing strategies.
